     * registration information is taken from FlowLogic version annotation. In session handshake sent by other party we
     * obtain general flow name this flow belongs to, because it makes flow version negotiation easier. If this flow name
     * has been registered then the corresponding factory will be used to create the flow
     * which will communicate with the other side. If there is no mapping then the session attempt is rejected.
     * Additionally we get version of this flow for advertising in NetworkMapService (you may want to hide it with [advertise]
     * flag in [FlowVersion]). Assumes that we have one version of this flow and takes it as a default when registering factory.
     * @param markerClass The marker [KClass] present in a session initiation attempt, which is a 1:1 mapping to a [Class]
     * using the <pre>::class</pre> construct. It has to be [FlowLogic] subclass. This enables the registration to be of the
     * form: registerFlowInitiator(InitiatorFlow::class, ::InitiatedFlow)
     * @param flowFactory The flow factory generating the initiated flow.
